  What is a good Visualization?
</h1>
</br >
<p>
  According to Cairo, a great visualization must have some certain qualities:
  </br >it should be truthful, functional, beautiful, insightful, and enlightening.

  The good example of visualization I chose is A New Chart of History by Joseph Priestley. Joseph Priestley was a British polymath in the 18th century, and he believed those charts could allow people to "trace out distinctly the dependence of events to distribute them into such periods and divisions as shall lay the whole claim of past transactions in just and orderly manner."A New Chart of History is a timeline that shows the simultaneous existence and influence of major empires and culture through history. It lists events in 106 separate locations, and the timeline illustrates the rise and fall of an empire and the shift of power.  Although abundant information leads to a visually busy chart, it doesn't have useless or complicated decorations. It also has different colors to label different empire, which makes people easier to distinguish. The chart presents data and information in a clear and elegant way. I was amazed by how Joseph Priestly provided people with an indelible image of the progress, extent, and duration of all the considerable empires by only using lines, colors, and a few words. Moreover, it enlightens me to think more about how those major empires interacted and why some of them collapsed.

 The bad example of visualization I chose is a chart about the wedding budget breakdown. Firstly, the data from the chart is definitely not based on thorough and honest research, and it doesn't provide any source. Secondly, the data provided is useless and meaningless, since it is not valid or representative. The designer merely gives a general result rather than categorized the data according to age or region. Furthermore, bars on the chart are out of proportion. It makes the chart inaccurate and misleading.
